## What it does 

Do you remember going to concerts? Ahh! Take a minute to remember that amazing experience. Ok, cut to 2021 and concerts, have not been in your life for at least a year. (Sad day) But now with Remember The Rhthym you can have a place to upload all those pictures and re-live the memories once more.

Here at Remembering the Rhthym a visitor can sign-in to access the full experience. Once signed in the User will be able to upload pictures to their Stage. The pictures can be seen as a collection of all the pictures that the User has updated, or can be seen by concert. Each picture can be tagged by the User to remember the special moments even more.


## How to Install Remembering The Rhthym

This application is not deployed to any hosting service and thus can be experienced utilizing `localhost:300`

To do this: 

1. Clone this repo to your local computer. There is a button green button in the upper rightside of this repo that, if you click it will allow you to put Remembering The Rhthym's code in your clipboard.
2. This application was written in Ruby and thus you will need some Rails commands. (I'll give them to you, don't worry)
3. Open up your terminal and paste this code into CLI (command line interface). If you are using a Mac, use the short cut `command + spacebar`. This will give you the `Spotlight Search` and you can start typing `terminal` and that will get you to the terminal even faster!
4. Open up another window in your terminal (I use the `command + t` shortcut) and spin up a rails server. You can do that by simply typing `rails s` and hitting enter.
5. This by default will be running on port :3000. 
6. Once your rails server is running, open up a new tab in your web browser. I use Chrome, but Safari or anyother web browser will work. Type in `localhost:3000` and viola you should be taken to the homepage of Remembering The Rhthym!
7. Now you can sign-in, upload pictures and remember all the rhthyms that made/make you sway!!!
